/**
 * ðŸ“Œ Build a traffic light where the lights switch from green to yellow to red after predetermined intervals and loop indefinitely. Each light should be lit for the following durations:

Red light: 4000ms
Yellow light: 500ms
Green light: 3000ms

Key take away from solving this problem,
ðŸ“Œ As we have no dependency array in the UseEffect, the useEffect will be triggered on every re-render.
ðŸ“Œ Whenever setTimeOut is trigered we are setting the state, setting of state re-renders the component and as a result the useEffect is rendered again.
ðŸ“Œ On every execution of useEffect the previous timer is cleared.
